Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing, Income Qualifications
Credit: I stole the second half of Income Qual from Manjay05 on Kaggle, the code repo is 2 years old, I assume this is why it errors out, and breaks the entire macro- it possibly lacks an OHE,
cannot classify objects in the necessary way- FutureError

I am learning Machine Learning by breaking things, I realize that some people won't like this, but, I'm a Data Scientist, not a Machine Learning Engineer, and I am helping my class-mates and interacting well with my instructor.
Even if this one Jupyter file kinda sucks, I am doing really good. This is partly just a message to me. Thanks for coming to my Ted-Talk.
